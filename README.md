# TypeScript BoilerPlate
A small boilerplate I use for personal TS projects 📝

Go [here](https://github.com/Fdebijl/tsbp/generate) to generate a new repo based on this boilerplate, or click the 'Use this template' button above.

Once you've cloned or downloaded the repo, simply run `npm run setup` to setup the project.
